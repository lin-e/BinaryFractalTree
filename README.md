# BinaryFractalTree
Probably generates binary fractal trees

I got bored and made this. I decided to challenge myself, and not use any online resources (the only thing I looked up was the graphics part, as I rarely worked with Windows.Forms). It's not efficient in any way, as it is a simple project I worked on during my holiday. The GUI should be simple enough to use, but there are settings for the angles of each line (as bearings), and of general rules throughout the binary tree.
